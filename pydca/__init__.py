"""pydca is python implementation of Direct Coupling Analysis for protein and RNA 
sequences. It implements two flavors of DCA: mean-field and pseudolikelihood maximization.

Both the mean-field and pseudolikelihood maximization algorithms provide Python API. 
The mean-field algorithm is implemented in Python whereas the pseudolikelihood parameter
inference part is implemented using C++11 backend.
